# Summary:

The usage of certain words, phrases, clauses, abbreviations, and references when conveying a message through the physical or digital medium may unknowingly associate the company with a particular political ideology. It may create a negative impact on the minds of the readers supporting other political ideas. As a result, some segment of the population might not accept the product thereby hampering the sales and growth of the company.

A survey was conducted by SurveyMonkey and Fortune on 10,000 U.S adults to identify the difference of opinions toward the top 100 companies. The results observed was that the liberalist like shopping at Target and drinking Pepsi. On the other hand, Conservatives prefer drinking Coke and shopping at Walmart.

Using Natural language processing and neural networks algorithms, I have built software that can classify the political bias of a written text. This software has achieved 90% accuracy in classifying a document as liberally or conservatively biased.
